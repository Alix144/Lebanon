          <h2>Lebanon</h2>
          <p class="pA">Lebanon has a heritage almost as old as the earliest evidence of mankind. Its geographic position as a crossroads linking <span
              id="dots">...</span><span id="more">the Mediterranean Basin with the great Asian hinterland has conferred on it a cosmopolitan character and a multicultural legacy. Lebanon has an Arab culture colored by Western influences.
              At different periods of its history, Lebanon has come under the domination of foreign rulers, including Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Ottomans. Although often conquered, the Lebanese take pride in their
              rebellions against despotic and repressive rulers. Moreover, despite foreign domination, Lebanon’s mountainous terrain has provided it with a certain protective isolation, enabling it to survive with an identity all its own.
              Its proximity to the sea has ensured that throughout its history Lebanon has held an important position as a trading center. This tradition of commerce began with the Phoenicians and continued through many centuries, remaining almost
              unaffected by foreign rule and the worst periods of internal strife.

In the first century B.C., it became a Roman colony, only to be destroyed later by a triple catastrophe of earthquake, tidal wave and fire in 551A.D. Arab control
              then dominated until the Crusaders took over in 1110. Following the Crusaders were the Mamlukes and the Turks. After World War I there was a French mandate period, and in 1943 Lebanon gained its independence.</span></p>

              architecture there as well.

During the Persian Empire the city provided the Persia with ships and seamen to fight the Egyptians and Greeks, which gave them a favored position within the Empire. During the Phoenician Era, glass manufacturing was Sidon’s most important enterprise along
              with purple dye. Sidon, like most states in Phoenicia, was subject to conquest. Alexander was one of many rulers who took the city. Under Alexander’s successors, the city enjoyed relative freedom. During the Roman reign in Sidon,
              theaters and other major monuments were built. After a turbulent Crusader age, which saw the city change hands numerous times, it finally fell under the control of Mamluke forces. Sidon flourished during the 15th and 17th centuries
              especially, due to its location and use as a port between France and Syria.

The Romans built many monuments in the city, including an aqueduct, a triumphal arch and the largest hippodrome in antiquity. Much later it
              was taken by the Byzantine Empire, until Islamic armies took over in 634. The city continued to prosper as a trading post. After a brief stint with Crusader rule, it was taken over by Ottomans until after World War I, when it was
              integrated into Lebanon. </span></p>
